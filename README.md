# aurelia-wijmo
An example of how to wrap the Wijmo control set from Component One and use them in Aurelia.

1.  Add the wj-input-date.ts/html files to your project.
2.  Add the <require> element to pull it into the html where you want to use it.
3.  Use <wj-input-date><wj-input-date> with the appropriate binding.  See the test files for a full example.
